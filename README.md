This repo is a summary of my school system projects. All projects are written in C. 
In these projects, I have implemented 
1) a efficient memory allocator, 
2) a multi-thread resource manager that can protect critical sections without having deadlock, 
3) a PNG file project, 
4) a HTTP project that is able to parsing an HTTP request, reading an HTTP request from a socket, and sending a response back to a mini server.
